# PRODIGY_DS_01
This project involves visualizing the distribution of demographic data using Python. 
We create a bar chart to show the distribution of genders and a histogram to display the distribution of ages. 
The dataset includes age and gender information for a sample population. 
Using matplotlib and seaborn libraries, we generate clear and informative charts to understand the demographic distribution effectively.
